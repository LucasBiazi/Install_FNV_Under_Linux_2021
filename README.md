# **How to install Fallou: New Vegas under Linux in 2021**

## Summary: 
Fallout: New Vegas is fan favorite and considered one of the best role-playing-games of the decade.
Installing New Vegas may not sound like a challenge, but when we talk about stability things change. In this brief guide I will be walking you through the process of installing and modding New Vegas under you Linux machine focusing on stability, so you can finally play for more than 5 minutes. Specifically in this guide I will be using Arch Linux (btw) and Steam, but since you are a Linux user, tweaking it for your distro shouldn’t be an issue considering that very little things will change (such as package manager, etc...). Are you ready?

## Getting the Game
Currently there are two ways to acquire Fallout: New Vegas, they are: buying directly from Bethesda or buying  it on Steam (this last one is the recommended). Assuming that you now have a official copy of the game, it is time to download it. Hopefully Valve has been changing the game for Linux users, and now playing Window’s games is more possible than ever. In order to download the game you first must **toggle the Steam Play** function.

It is localized in:
Steam > Settings > Steam Play
